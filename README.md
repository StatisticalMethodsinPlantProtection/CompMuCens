# About this document

This document serves as a brief guide for the use of the R analysis program included in the study "Survival Analysis as a Basis to Test Hypotheses When Using Quantitative Ordinal Scale Disease Severity Data," submitted for revision to Phytopathology. 

## It is divided into three sections:
  - (1) an overview of the sample data,
  - (2) an introduction to the program,
  - and (3) an examination of the analysis performed on the sample data, including interpretation of the results.

##

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the issues regarding "**quantitative ordinal scales**" (QOS) interval-censored data in plant pathology, and we believe they are an important consideration for the discipline. In order to assist plant pathologists in analyzing QOS data and encourage the uptake of the interval-censored analysis method, we have provided a comprehensive explanation of the program code used to implement class ratings analyzed through this method. The information demonstrates that the process for analyzing interval-censored survival data using this method is straightforward. As noted above, the method can be applied to reduce the risk of type II errors when considering QOS data, which are widely used in plant pathology and related disciplines.
